          <h2>Defeat Magus tournament</h2>
          <ul>
            <li id="a01"><p>Q: What is the tournament format and the rules?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: The tournament will run from <strong>16 January 2017</strong> until <strong>25 March 2017</strong>.<br>
              After the sign-up you have until the <strong>31 December 2016</strong> to contact us and drop out from the tournament. This will help us to do a better job for the pool.<br>
              The tournament is set in two phase : <strong>Pool phase</strong> and <strong>Bracket phase</strong>.<br><br>
              The <strong>Pool phase</strong> will take <strong>5</strong> weeks. Each pool will be organized with: 1 expert, 1 medium, 1/2 low skill (depending on entries) runners.<br>
              In this phase every one will race each other twice. Participants will be ranked based on win count. Ties will be broken by average race time. The first 2 of every pool will move on to the bracket.<br><br>
              The <strong>Bracket phase</strong>. Just like a normal bracket but with fixed date. All the dates will be provided before the end of the pool phase.<br>
              Some pool races and all the bracket races will be hosted on the community twitch channel. Because of this we will tell you when a race will be hosted (at least 1 day before) and be sure to come 15 min earlier.</p></li>

            <li id="a02"><p>Q: What do I have to do and know before racing?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: Here’s a list of steps on what to do in order to race:</p>
              <dl class="">
                <dt>step 1</dt>
                <dd>Register on <a href="http://www.speedrunslive.com/">SpeedrunsLive</a>, <a href="http://www.twitch.tv">Twitch.tv</a> or <a href="http://www.hitbox.tv">hitbox.tv</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/8e5s7G">Discord</a>. Try to use the same name for all.</dd>
                <br><dt>Step 2</dt>
                <dd>Download <a href="http://livesplit.org">Livesplit</a>, create your own split or <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9HJd6-ImpfFVVRwMHJ5S3FJeEE">download it</a>. You will be able to login with the SRL account and enter into an already existing or create a new race.</dd>
                <br><dt>Step 3</dt>
                <dd>You have 5 weeks to complete the 2 runs against all the runner in your Pool. Contact your opponent on discord or twitch, set a date and time, run! If both runners want a practice race can be done. This will not modify the pool points.</dd>
                <br><dt>Step 4</dt>
                <dd>All the official races for the tournament will be announced on both discord and <a href="#">spreadsheet</a>(Soon).</dd>

                <br><dt>Step 6</dt>
                <dd>Race! Open up the channel on IRC/Livesplit with the goal set to ‘Defeat Magus’ and start the race at the date and time you stated! (It doesn’t have to be exactly at x hour but since people will want to watch the races, so we encourage you to be as punctual as possible).</dd>

          <h2>FAQs</h2>
          <ul>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a03"><p>Q: I’ve seen Chrono Carts (US) go for over $100 online, do I have to buy one to race?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: You don’t have to do that! Luckily Chrono Trigger emulates pretty well so you can race on Emulator (Check <abbr title="SpeedrunsLive">SRL</abbr> for banned emulators <a href="http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/rules/#while">list</a>) or get it for the Wii Virtual Console (not recommended) and race! If you are going to use emulator you should use Snes9x 1.53 or Bizhawk if your computer can handle it.</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a04"><p>Q: I am new to speedrunning, what program do you use for the timers on the streams?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: We suggest <a href="http://livesplit.org">LiveSplit</a> for its compatibility with <abbr title="SpeedrunsLive">SRL</abbr> . It’s really simple to setup.</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a05"><p>Q: I want to do more race. I can do it?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: Yes, you can! The result will not influence your pool points. We recommend to race against different runner to improve yourself, feel how can be racing and know new runner.</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a06"><p>Q: What is SpeedrunsLive channel? How do I race there?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: <a href="http://www.speedrunslive.com/">SpeedrunsLive.com</a> in short <abbr title="SpeedrunsLive">SRL</abbr> is a website speedrunners use to have a track of their race, if you’re new to this please read the <a href="http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/">FAQs</a>. Basically what you have to do is setup a nickname (Preferably same as your Twitch Name).<br>
              Once you create your account on SRL, is possible to login in Livesplit and join/create race.<br>
              Livesplit is perfect because the timer will start after the start countdown and end at the last split.<br>
              Race and the results will be saved in the SRL webpage and this is just another way for us to make sure the players did finish with the time they stated and we can compare SRL time to the time in their stream if there were to be any incongruences.</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a07"><p>Q: I’ve never speedrun Chrono Trigger before, where does the time start and end?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: For the race we will be starting the time in the ‘active / wait’ screen. As soon as the timer starts you can select 'Wait' and start the run.<br>
              The timer stops as soon as Magus takes a knee. When you defeat Magus you get xp, gold, etc... Then about 3 seconds pass and Magus takes a knee, right there the timer stops. The reason we do this is to have a fixed ending point for everyone running this category.</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a08"><p>Q: I’ve never ran this game before… Am I going to be racing against the 1st place in my first race because of this? If so, then I might not join just to lose… :(</p></li>
            <li><p>A: Even if you’ve never ran before, there’s a great deal of resources to learn the run, and a bunch of people willing to help. Because of the ways the pools are organised, you’ll get to participate in at least 4 matches, even if you lose them all. And, once you’re out of the tourney, you can still race with anyone, anytime!</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a09"><p>Q: How long is a Defeat Magus run going to take me? Took me 3 weeks to get there as a kid.... Am I going to be up all night???</p></li>
            <li><p>A: Not at all! A great Defeat Magus time is around 1:50, so if this is your first time running this game and you followed the tutorials/route, you will be done in under 2:40 hours for sure. With the times only getting better from there!</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a10"><p>Q: I am loving speedrunning this game! Are there other categories I can speedrun?!?!?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: There sure are! We have <abbr title="Any% Lavos Shell Skip">Any%</abbr>, <abbr title="Any% No Lavos Shell Skip">Any% No LSS</abbr>, <abbr title="All sidequest">100%</abbr>, All Endings and <abbr title="New Game+">NG+</abbr> so pick your favorite. You can go to <a href="www.chrono.wikidot.com/strategies">Chrono.wikidot.com/strategies</a> to check rules for this categories as well as times/routes, tutorials, etc... We also have a page on <a href="http://www.speedrun.com/ct">Speedrun.com/ct</a> but we only use that to update times.</p></li>

          <ul>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a11"><p>Q: Console, <abbr title="Wii Virtual Console">Wii VC</abbr> or emulator? </p></li>
            <li><p> A: Original console is always better. Less input lag and less loading time. If you can’t afford a cart / capture card for the tournament we suggest to use an emulator ( Snes9x 1.53 or Bizhawk).We don’t raccommand to run on <abbr title="Wii Virtual Console">Wii VC</abbr> because certain strats may not work, and VC can crash really easy.</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a12"><p>Q: Can you give me the link for the rom?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: We don’t provide the link for it. Just use google. </p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a13"><p>Q: Why english and not japanese?</p></li>
            <li><p> Japanese has faster text, as one might expect. But, the run makes use of a glitch called “the deequip glitch” which gives a boost to magic defense and attack. In the Japanese version, the benefits of this glitch aren’t as good, and so Japanese loses the time it gains on text in battles.</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a14"><p>Q: I have trouble with the first fight. Why? </p></li>
            <li><p> A: Maybe you didn’t delete your saves and restart the game.In the saves screen press Start+select and the delete dialog will popup. After that restart the game with L+R+Start+Select (soft-reset) and you are done.</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a15"><p>Q: Can I use the practice rom/lua screen to do the race? </p></li>
            <li><p> A: Running any lua script, or using ramwatch, or exploiting any feature not available on original hardware (turbo, fastforward, scripts, ramwatch) is considered cheating.</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a16"><p>Q: On wikidot I found the ElGranJerry tutorial + his notes. I can use that?</p></li>
            <li><p> A: Of course. That is the old route for the Magus%. There are few difference between that and the new route, but you will be able to run until Magus with that.</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a17"><p>Q: The CronoKirby notes are hard to read. Can you explain them to me? </p></li>
            <li><p>A: There’s a notation section at the top of the guide, feel free to ask questions about the notes though. </p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a18"><p>Q: Why CronoKirby change buttons in the beginning of the run?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: For guardian skip, you can’t have your menu on “X” (simplified). So you need to change it to something else for the skip, and then back afterwards (or play with controls changed for the rest of the run). Switching X with Y at the beginning of the run solves those problems, and, can make fadeouts easier to do, depending on your controller grip.</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a19"><p>Q: What is Load / backup load? </p></li>
            <li><p>A: RNG can be manipulated via resetting and waiting on the save screen (c.f. Beginning of the 100% tutorial)</p></li>
            <!-- ## -->
            <li id="a20"><p>Q: I need more help with things that are not in this FAQs.</p></li>
            <li><p>A: Don't worry about it. Just join <a href="https://goo.gl/8e5s7G">discord</a> and ask!</p></li>
